```bash
npm run dev
```
### If successful, you should see:

```arduino
Server running on port 5000
MongoDB Connected: <your_connection_url>

## 📮 Testing the API
⚠️ Many backend routes require valid Google-authenticated tokens and parameters, which are only generated by the frontend.

Before testing with Postman or any API client, make sure to also set up the frontend part of the app.

## 📌 Notes
> Authentication is fully handled via Google OAuth — no manual JWT management is needed.
> Backend routes are protected using middleware that verifies Google sessions/tokens.
> To test functionality end-to-end, ensure both frontend and backend are running and properly connected.

## ✅ Summary
- This backend service is the backbone of the CRM app — managing users, campaigns, and core business logic. Built for scalability, it integrates seamlessly with the frontend and is designed for secure, reliable operation with Google OAuth as the primary authentication layer.
